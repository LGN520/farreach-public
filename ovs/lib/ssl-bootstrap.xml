      When <var>cacert.pem</var> exists, this option has the same effect
      as <code>-C</code> or <code>--ca-cert</code>. If it does not exist,
      then the executable will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the
      SSL peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named PEM
      file.  If it is successful, it will immediately drop the connection
      and reconnect, and from then on all SSL connections must be
      authenticated by a certificate signed by the CA certificate thus
      obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle
      attack obtaining the initial CA certificate, but it may be useful
      for bootstrapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as
      part of the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol does not require
      the server to send the CA certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option is mutually exclusive with <code>-C</code> and
      <code>--ca-cert</code>.
