      Sets the process in "recording" mode, in which it will record all the
      connections, data from streams (Unix domain and network sockets) and some
      other necessary bits, so they could be replayed later.

      Recorded data is stored in replay files in specified

      <code>/<code>, it is interpreted as relative to <code>@RUNDIR@</code>.
      If <var>directory</var> is not specified, <code>@RUNDIR@</code> will

      Sets the process in "replay" mode, in which it will read information
      about connections, data from streams (Unix domain and network sockets)
      and some other necessary bits directly from replay files instead of using
