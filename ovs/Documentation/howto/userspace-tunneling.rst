Connecting VMs Using Tunnels (Userspace)
========================================

This document describes how to use Open vSwitch to allow VMs on two different
hosts to communicate over VXLAN tunnels. Unlike :doc:`tunneling`, this
configuration works entirely in userspace.

.. note::

   This guide covers the steps required to configure VXLAN tunneling. The same
   approach can be used for any of the other tunneling protocols supported by
   Open vSwitch.

Setup
-----

This guide assumes the environment is configured as described below.

Two Physical Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The environment assumes the use of two hosts, named `host1` and `host2`. We
only detail the configuration of `host1` but a similar configuration can be
used for `host2`. Both hosts should be configured with Open vSwitch (with or
without DPDK), QEMU/KVM and suitable VM images. Open vSwitch should be running
before proceeding.

Configuration Steps
-------------------

Perform the following configuration on `host1`:

#. Create a ``br-int`` bridge::

       $ ovs-vsctl --may-exist add-br br-int \
         -- set Bridge br-int datapath_type=netdev \
         -- br-set-external-id br-int bridge-id br-int \
         -- set bridge br-int fail-mode=standalone

#. Add a port to this bridge. If using tap ports, first boot a VM and then add
   the port to the bridge::

       $ ovs-vsctl add-port br-int tap0

   If using DPDK vhost-user ports, add the port and then boot the VM
   accordingly, using ``vm_port0`` as the interface name::

       $ ovs-vsctl add-port br-int vm_port0 \
           -- set Interface vm_port0 type=dpdkvhostuser

#. Configure the IP address of the VM interface *in the VM itself*::

       $ ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0
       $ ip link set eth0 up

#. On `host1`, add a port for the VXLAN tunnel::

       $ ovs-vsctl add-port br-int vxlan0 \
         -- set interface vxlan0 type=vxlan options:remote_ip=172.168.1.2

   .. note::

      ``172.168.1.2`` is the remote tunnel end point address. On the remote
      host this will be ``172.168.1.1``

#. Create a ``br-phy`` bridge::

       $ ovs-vsctl --may-exist add-br br-phy \
           -- set Bridge br-phy datapath_type=netdev \
           -- br-set-external-id br-phy bridge-id br-phy \
           -- set bridge br-phy fail-mode=standalone \
                other_config:hwaddr=<mac address of eth1 interface>

   .. note::

      This additional bridge is required when running Open vSwitch in userspace
      rather than kernel-based Open vSwitch. The purpose of this bridge is to
      allow use of the kernel network stack for routing and ARP resolution.
      The datapath needs to look-up the routing table and ARP table to prepare
      the tunnel header and transmit data to the output port.

   .. note::

      ``eth1`` is used rather than ``eth0``. This is to ensure network
      connectivity is retained.

#. Attach ``eth1``/``dpdk0`` to the ``br-phy`` bridge.

   If the physical port ``eth1`` is operating as a kernel network interface,
   run::

       $ ovs-vsctl --timeout 10 add-port br-phy eth1
       $ ip addr add 172.168.1.1/24 dev br-phy
       $ ip link set br-phy up
       $ ip addr flush dev eth1 2>/dev/null
       $ ip link set eth1 up
       $ iptables -F

   If instead the interface is a DPDK interface and bound to the ``igb_uio`` or
   ``vfio`` driver, run::

       $ ovs-vsctl --timeout 10 add-port br-phy dpdk0 \
         -- set Interface dpdk0 type=dpdk options:dpdk-devargs=0000:06:00.0
       $ ip addr add 172.168.1.1/24 dev br-phy
       $ ip link set br-phy up
       $ iptables -F

   The commands are different as DPDK interfaces are not managed by the kernel,
   thus, the port details are not visible to any ``ip`` commands.

   .. important::

      Attempting to use the kernel network commands for a DPDK interface will
      result in a loss of connectivity through ``eth1``. Refer to
      :doc:`/faq/configuration` for more details.

Once complete, check the cached routes using ovs-appctl command::

    $ ovs-appctl ovs/route/show

If the tunnel route is missing, adding it now::

    $ ovs-appctl ovs/route/add 172.168.1.1/24 br-phy

Repeat these steps if necessary for `host2`, but using ``192.168.1.1`` and
``172.168.1.2`` for the VM and tunnel interface IP addresses, respectively.

Testing
-------

With this setup, ping to VXLAN target device (``192.168.1.2``) should work.
Traffic will be VXLAN encapsulated and sent over the ``eth1``/``dpdk0``
interface.
