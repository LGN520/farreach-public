      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

Open vSwitch on NetBSD
======================

On NetBSD, you might want to install requirements from pkgsrc.  In that case,
you need at least the following packages.

- automake
- libtool-base
- gmake
- python37

Some components have additional requirements. Refer to :doc:`general` for more
information.

Assuming you are running NetBSD/amd64 7.0.2, you can download and install
pre-built binary packages as the following::

    $ PKG_PATH=http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/amd64/7.0.2/All/
    $ export PKG_PATH
    $ pkg_add automake libtool-base gmake python37 pkg_alternatives

.. note::
  You might get some warnings about minor version mismatch. These can be safely
  ignored.

NetBSD's ``/usr/bin/make`` is not GNU make.  GNU make is installed as
``/usr/pkg/bin/gmake`` by the above mentioned ``gmake`` package.

As all executables installed with pkgsrc are placed in ``/usr/pkg/bin/``
directory, it might be a good idea to add it to your PATH. Or install OVS by
``gmake`` and ``gmake install``.

Open vSwitch on NetBSD is currently "userspace switch" implementation in the
sense described in :doc:`userspace` and :doc:`/topics/porting`.
