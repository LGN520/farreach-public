.SH NAME
vtep\-ctl \- utility for querying and configuring a VTEP database
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand
\fR[\fIargs\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand \fR[\fIargs\fR]]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBvtep\-ctl\fR program configures a VTEP database.
See \fBvtep\fR(5) for comprehensive documentation of
the database schema.
.PP
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR connects to an \fBovsdb\-server\fR process that
maintains a VTEP configuration database.  Using this connection, it
queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending on the
supplied commands.
.PP
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR can perform any number of commands in a single run,
implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.
.PP
The \fBvtep\-ctl\fR command line begins with global options (see
\fBOPTIONS\fR below for details).  The global options are followed by
one or more commands.  Each command should begin with \fB\-\-\fR by
itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from the following
commands.  (The \fB\-\-\fR before the first command is optional.)  The
command itself starts with command-specific options, if any, followed by
the command name and any arguments.  See \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for syntax
examples.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
The following options affect the behavior \fBvtep\-ctl\fR as a whole.
Some individual commands also accept their own options, which are
given just before the command name.  If the first command on the
command line has options, then those options must be separated from
the global options by \fB\-\-\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-db=\fIserver\fR"
Sets \fIserver\fR as the database server that \fBvtep\-ctl\fR contacts
to query or modify configuration.  \fIserver\fR may be an OVSDB active
or passive connection method, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7).  The
default is \fBunix:@RUNDIR@/db.sock\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-syslog\fR"
By default, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR logs its arguments and the details of any
changes that it makes to the system log.  This option disables this
logging.
.IP
This option is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose=vtep_ctl:syslog:warn\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-oneline\fR"
Modifies the output format so that the output for each command is printed
on a single line.  New-line characters that would otherwise separate
lines are printed as \fB\\n\fR, and any instances of \fB\\\fR that
would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.
Prints a blank line for each command that has no output.
This option does not affect the formatting of output from the
\fBlist\fR or \fBfind\fR commands; see \fBTable Formatting Options\fR
below.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR"
Prevents \fBvtep\-ctl\fR from actually modifying the database.
.
.IP "\fB\-t \fIsecs\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-timeout=\fIsecs\fR"
By default, or with a \fIsecs\fR of \fB0\fR, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR waits
forever for a response from the database.  This option limits runtime
to approximately \fIsecs\fR seconds.  If the timeout expires,
\fBvtep\-ctl\fR will exit with a \fBSIGALRM\fR signal.  (A timeout
would normally happen only if the database cannot be contacted, or if
the system is overloaded.)

.SH COMMANDS
The commands implemented by \fBvtep\-ctl\fR are described in the
sections below.
.
.SS "Physical Switch Commands"
These commands examine and manipulate physical switches.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-ps \fIpswitch\fR"
Creates a new physical switch named \fIpswitch\fR.  Initially the switch
will have no ports.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a switch that
exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does
nothing if \fIpswitch\fR already exists.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-ps \fIpswitch\fR"
Deletes \fIpswitch\fR and all of its ports.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a switch that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a switch that does not exist has no effect.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-ps\fR"
Lists all existing physical switches on standard output, one per line.
.
.IP "\fBps\-exists \fIpswitch\fR"
Tests whether \fIpswitch\fR exists.  If so, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR exits
successfully with exit code 0.  If not, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR exits
unsuccessfully with exit code 2.
.

.
These commands examine and manipulate VTEP physical ports.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-ports \fIpswitch\fR"
Lists all of the ports within \fIpswitch\fR on standard output, one per
line.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-port \fIpswitch port\fR"
Creates on \fIpswitch\fR a new port named \fIport\fR from the network
device of the same name.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a port that exists
is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does nothing if

.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-port \fR[\fIpswitch\fR] \fIport\fR"
Deletes \fIport\fR.  If \fIpswitch\fR is omitted, \fIport\fR is removed
from whatever switch contains it; if \fIpswitch\fR is specified, it
must be the switch that contains \fIport\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a port that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a port that does not exist has no effect.

combination on the physical switch \fIpswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBunbind\-ls \fIpswitch port vlan\fR"

\fIpswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBset\-replication\-mode \fIlswitch replication\-mode\fR"
Set logical switch \fIlswitch\fR replication mode to
\fIreplication\-mode\fR; the only valid values for replication mode
are "service_node" and "source_node".
.
For handling L2 broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic,
packets can be sent to all members of a logical switch referenced by
a physical switch.  There are different modes to replicate the
packets.  The default mode of replication is to send the traffic to
a service node, which can be a hypervisor, server or appliance, and
let the service node handle replication to other transport nodes
(hypervisors or other VTEP physical switches).  This mode is called
service node replication.  An alternate mode of replication, called
source node replication involves the source node sending to all
other transport nodes.  Hypervisors are always responsible for doing
their own replication for locally attached VMs in both modes.
Service node mode is the default, if the replication mode is not
explicitly set.  Service node replication mode is considered a basic
requirement because it only requires sending the packet to a single
transport node.
.
.IP "\fBget\-replication\-mode \fIlswitch\fR"
Get logical switch \fIlswitch\fR replication mode.  The only valid values
for replication mode are "service_node" and "source_node".  An empty reply
for replication mode implies a default of "service_node".
.
.SS "Logical Router Commands"
These commands examine and manipulate logical routers.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-lr \fIlrouter\fR"
Creates a new logical router named \fIlrouter\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a router that
exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does
nothing if \fIlrouter\fR already exists.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-lr \fIlrouter\fR"
Deletes \fIlrouter\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a router that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a router that does not exist has no effect.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-lr\fR"
Lists all existing logical routers on standard output, one per line.
.
.IP "\fBlr\-exists \fIlrouter\fR"
Tests whether \fIlrouter\fR exists.  If so, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR exits
successfully with exit code 0.  If not, \fBvtep\-ctl\fR exits
unsuccessfully with exit code 2.

.SS "Local MAC Binding Commands"
These commands examine and manipulate local MAC bindings for the logical
switch.  The local maps are written by the VTEP to refer to MACs it has
learned on its physical ports.
.
.IP "\fBadd\-ucast\-local \fIlswitch mac\fR [\fIencap\fR] \fIip\fR"
Map the unicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR to the physical location
\fIip\fR using encapsulation \fIencap\fR on \fIlswitch\fR.  If
\fIencap\fR is not specified, the default is "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The
local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to MACs learned on its
physical ports.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-ucast\-local \fIlswitch mac\fR"
Remove the local unicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR map from
\fIlswitch\fR.  The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to MACs

Add physical location \fIip\fR using encapsulation \fIencap\fR to the
local mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR on
\fIlswitch\fR.  If \fIencap\fR is not specified, the default is
"vxlan_over_ipv4".  The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to
MACs learned on its physical ports.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-mcast\-local \fIlswitch mac\fR [\fIencap\fR] \fIip\fR"
Remove physical location \fIip\fR using encapsulation \fIencap\fR from
the local mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR on
\fIlswitch\fR.  If \fIencap\fR is not specified, the default is
"vxlan_over_ipv4".  The local mappings are used by the VTEP to refer to
MACs learned on its physical ports.
.
.IP "\fBclear\-local\-macs \fIlswitch\fR"
Clear the local MAC bindings for \fIlswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-local\-macs \fIlswitch\fR"
List the local MAC bindings for \fIlswitch\fR, one per line.
.
.SS "Remote MAC Binding Commands"
These commands examine and manipulate local and remote MAC bindings for
the logical switch.  The remote maps are written by the network
virtualization controller to refer to MACs that it has learned.
.
.IP "\fBadd\-ucast\-remote \fIlswitch mac\fR [\fIencap\fR] \fIip\fR"
Map the unicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR to the physical location
\fIip\fR using encapsulation \fIencap\fR on \fIlswitch\fR.  If
\fIencap\fR is not specified, the default is "vxlan_over_ipv4".  The
remote mappings are used by the network virtualization platform to refer
to MACs that it has learned.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-ucast\-remote \fIlswitch mac\fR"
Remove the remote unicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR map from
\fIlswitch\fR.  The remote mappings are used by the network
virtualization platform to refer to MACs that it has learned.
.
.IP "\fBadd\-mcast\-remote \fIlswitch mac\fR [\fIencap\fR] \fIip\fR"
Add physical location \fIip\fR using encapsulation \fIencap\fR to the
remote mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR on
\fIlswitch\fR.  If \fIencap\fR is not specified, the default is
"vxlan_over_ipv4".  The remote mappings are used by the network
virtualization platform to refer to MACs that it has learned.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-mcast\-remote \fIlswitch mac\fR [\fIencap\fR] \fIip\fR"
Remove physical location \fIip\fR using encapsulation \fIencap\fR from
the remote mac binding table for multicast Ethernet address \fImac\fR on
\fIlswitch\fR.  If \fIencap\fR is not specified, the default is
"vxlan_over_ipv4".  The remote mappings are used by the network
virtualization platform to refer to MACs that it has learned.
.
.IP "\fBclear\-remote\-macs \fIlswitch\fR"
Clear the remote MAC bindings for \fIlswitch\fR.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-remote\-macs \fIlswitch\fR"
List the remote MAC bindings for \fIlswitch\fR, one per line.
.
.SS "Manager Connectivity"
.
These commands manipulate the \fBmanagers\fR column in the \fBGlobal\fR
table and rows in the \fBManagers\fR table.  When \fBovsdb\-server\fR is
configured to use the \fBmanagers\fR column for OVSDB connections (as
described in the startup scripts provided with Open vSwitch), this
allows the administrator to use \fBvtep\-ctl\fR to configure database
connections.
.
.IP "\fBget\-manager\fR"
Prints the configured manager(s).
.
.IP "\fBdel\-manager\fR"
Deletes the configured manager(s).
.
.IP "\fBset\-manager\fR \fItarget\fR\&..."
Sets the configured manager target or targets.
Each \fItarget\fR may be an OVSDB active or passive connection method,
e.g. \fBpssl:6640\fR, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7).
.
.SS "Database Commands"
.
These commands query and modify the contents of \fBovsdb\fR tables.
They are a slight abstraction of the \fBovsdb\fR interface and as such
they operate at a lower level than other \fBvtep\-ctl\fR commands.
.PP
.ST "Identifying Tables, Records, and Columns"
.PP
Each of these commands has a \fItable\fR parameter to identify a table
within the database.  Many of them also take a \fIrecord\fR parameter
that identifies a particular record within a table.  The \fIrecord\fR
parameter may be the UUID for a record, and many tables offer
additional ways to identify records.  Some commands also take
\fIcolumn\fR parameters that identify a particular field within the
records in a table.
.PP
The following tables are currently defined:
.IP "\fBGlobal\fR"
Top-level configuration for a hardware VTEP.  This table contains
exactly one record, identified by specifying \fB.\fR as the record name.
.IP "\fBManager\fR"
Configuration for an OVSDB connection.  Records may be identified
by target (e.g. \fBtcp:1.2.3.4\fR).
.IP "\fBPhysical_Switch\fR"
A physical switch that implements a VTEP.  Records may be identified by
physical switch name.
.IP "\fBPhysical_Port\fR"
A port within a physical switch.
.IP "\fBLogical_Binding_Stats\fR"
Reports statistics for the logical switch with which a VLAN on a
physical port is associated.
.IP "\fBLogical_Switch\fR"
A logical Ethernet switch.  Records may be identified by logical switch
name.
.IP "\fBUcast_Macs_Local\fR"
Mapping of locally discovered unicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBUcast_Macs_Remote\fR"
Mapping of remotely programmed unicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBMcast_Macs_Local\fR"
Mapping of locally discovered multicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBMcast_Macs_Remote\fR"
Mapping of remotely programmed multicast MAC addresses to tunnels.
.IP "\fBPhysical_Locator_Set\fR"
A set of one or more physical locators.
.IP "\fBPhysical_Locator\fR"
Identifies an endpoint to which logical switch traffic may be
encapsulated and forwarded.  Records may be identified by physical
locator name.
.PP
Record names must be specified in full and with correct
capitalization, except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their first 4
(or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within the table.
Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and \fB\-\fR and
\fB_\fR are treated interchangeably.  Unique abbreviations of table
and column names are acceptable, e.g. \fBman\fR or \fBm\fR is
sufficient to identify the \fBManager\fR table.
