# Tofino-based NetREACH (voting-based) + DPDK-based XIndex (in-memory KVS) + variable-length key-value pair w/ snapshot (netreach-voting-v3-memory)

- Client calculates op_hdr.hashidx as slot index to reduce 1 stage (similar as OmniMon)
	+ We calculate meta.hashidx for hash partition in switch
- Offload some functions to egress pipeline to reduce stages
- Using 4B for each unit of key instead of 2B to reduce 1 stage

## Overview

- Design features
	+ Parameter-free decision
		* Existing: large parameter -> miss hot keys; small parameter -> too many hot keys -> insufficient cache capacity and switch OS bottleneck
		* Challenge: Slow warmup with incast populations -> data-plane-based cache population
			- NOTE: Mirroring GETRES_POP_EVICT/PUTREQ_POP_EVICT does not incur switch OS bottleneck since we do not need send old key-value pair
			to server if the entry is invalid during warmup phase
	+ Data-plane-based cache update
		* Data-plane-based value update
		* Data-plane-based cache population
			- GETREQ: response-based cache population
			- PUTREQ: recirculation-based cache population
			- Atomicity: 
				+ Use lock bit + recirculation-based blocking
				+ Use seq to cope with packet reordering of PUT
				+ Controller periodically checks lock bit to cope with rare packet loss
			- NOTE: recirculation is acceptable
				+ We do not block normal packets
				+ NetReach packets must be hashed into the same slot with different keys of currently cached one
				+ Population time is limited: us-level for GET and ns-level for PUT
				+ # of blocked packets is limited by # of clients (e.g., one thread in a host) due to one-by-one pattern of NetReach client library
			- NOTE: recirculation-based blocking guarantees that version of switch >= server
	+ Crash-consistent backup
		* Case 1: change on in-switch cache value;
		* Case 2: change on in-switch cache key-value pair;
		* Case 3: change on server KVS for range query;
	+ TODO: Others
		* CBF-based fast path
		* Range query support
		* Switch-driven consistent hashing
		* Distributed extension
		* Variable-length key-value
- Term routine
	+ Match: just compare without changing packet header field
	+ Get: load to change packet header field (or metadata field)
	+ Set: store new value without changing packet header field
	+ Set_and_get: store new value and change packet header field with old value
	+ Reset: reset value as 0
	+ Init: initialize value as 1

	+ Overview
		* Stage 0: keylolo, keylohi, keyhilo, keyhihi, load_backup_tbl
			- For key, we provide two operations: match, set_and_get
		* Stage 1: valid, vote, seq (assign only if key matches for PUT/DELREQ -> assign for each PUT/DELREQ), update_iskeymatch_tbl
		* Stage 2: savedseq, lock, 
		* Stage 3: vallen, vallo1, valhi1, case12
			- For vallen and val, we provide two operations: get, set_and_get
		* Stage 4-10: from val2 to val15
		* Stage 11: vallo16, valhi16, port_forward_tbl
		* Egress pipeline
			- For cloned packet
				+ If PUTREQ/DELREQ/PUTREQ_RECIR/DELREQ_RECIR, update as PUT/DELRES/PUTRES to client
				+ If GETRES_POP (with new key-value), update it as GETRES to client
				+ If PUTREQ_POP (with new key-value), update it as PUTRES to client
			- For non-cloned packet
				- Hash parition for normal REQ pacekts
				- TODO: Access per-server iscase3 and seq2
				- TODO: Access eg_port_forward_tbl
					- TODO: For PUT/DELREQ, and PUT/DELREQ_RECIR
						+ If iscase3=0, update it as PUT/DELREQ_CASE3 to server
						+ Otherwise, update it as PUT/DELREQ to server
					- TODO: If PUTREQ/GETRES_POP_EVICT and PUTREQ_LARGE_INVALIDATE, embed seq2, and clone_e2e for switchOS thread
						+ Not use seq
							* GETRES_POP does not have seq for eviction if any
							* seq is not continuous for server -> space consuming
						+ Use seq2 for each eviction from switch to each server
							* Server only needs to remember the missed seq2 numbers -> avoid overwrites under packet loss
						+ Bandwidth overhead of switch OS and memory cost of servers are limited, as eviction is rare under skewed workload and packet loss is rare

## How to run

- Prepare for YCSB
	- Prepare workload for loading or transaction phase
		+ For example:
		+ `./bin/ycsb.sh load basic -P workloads/workloada -P netbuffer.dat > workloada-load.out`
		+ `./bin/ycsb.sh run basic -P workloads/workloada -P netbuffer.dat > workloada-run.out`
		+ `./split_workload load`
		+ `./split_workload run`
- Server
	- `./ycsb_local_client` for loading phase
	- `./ycsb_server` for server-side in transaction phase
- Client
	- `./ycsb_remote_client` for client-side in transaction phase
- Switch
	- Run `cd tofino`
	+ Run `su` to enter root account
	+ Run `bash compile.sh` to compile p4 into binary code
	+ Run `bash start_switch.sh` to launch Tofino
	+ Create a new terminal and run `bash configure.sh` to configure data plane
	+ `bash controller.sh setup`
	+ END: `bash controller.sh cleanup`
- Directory structure
	+ Raw workload file: workloada-load.out, workloada-run.out
	+ Split workload file: e.g., workloada-load-5/2.out
	+ Database directory: e.g., /tmp/netbuffer/workloada/group0.db, /tmp/netbuffer/workloada/buffer0-0.db
	+ RMI model at root node when init key-value store: workloada-root.out

## Simple test

- NOTE: update bucket_num in config.ini as 1 before test
- Test cases of normal operations: See directory of "testcases/normal" (with only 1 bucket in sketch)
	+ Case 1: single read (GET evicts invalid)
		* Read the value of a given key

	+ Case 2: single write (PUT evicts invalid)
		* Write new value for a given key
		* It should write the value into switch by recirculation and sendback PUTRES (no PUTREQ_POP)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val, seq = 1, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1

	+ Case 4: read-after-two-writes
		* Write value of k1 twice, and then read k1

	+ Case 5: write-after-read1
		* Read value of k1 and then write k1
		* It reads the value of k1 from server and store it in switch, PUT increases vote, updates vallen & val, and does not touch server

	+ Case 6: write-after-read2
		* Read value of k1 and then write k2
		* It should read the value of k1 from server and store it in switch, k2 will decrease vote and be forwarded to server (no cache update)

	+ Case 7: two-writes-after-read (PUT evicts GET)
		* Read value of k1 and then write k2 twice
		* It should read the value of k1 from server and store it in switch, k2 will replace k1 finally (PUTs touch server only once)

	+ Case 8: read-after-two-writes-after-write (PUT evicts PUT)
		* Write value of k1, write k2 twice, and then read k2
		* PUT of k1 writes the value in switch and sendback PUTRES, 1st PUT of k2 is forwarded to server, 2nd PUT of k2 evicts k1, GET
		is directly processed by switch
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of 2nd k2, seq = 3, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 2
	+ Case 9: two-reads-after-write (GET evicts PUT)
		* Write value of k1, read k2 twice
		* It writes value of k1 in switch, GETs of k2 evicted k1 (the evicted data touches server)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k2, seq = 1, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1
	+ Case 10: two-reads-after-read (GET evicts GET)
		* Read value of k1, read k2 twice
		* It first gets value of k1 from server and stores it in switch, the 2nd GET of k2 replaces k1 in switch
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k2, seq = 0, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1
	+ Case 11: read-delete-read
		* Read value of k1, delete k1, and then read k1 again
		* It first gets value of k1 from server and stores it in switch, then it deletes k1 (set vallen=0 without changing valid and vote), the 2nd GET
		of k1 gets a value of size 0 
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen=0, and val of k1, seq = 0, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 2
- Test cases of crash-consistent backup and range query: See "testcases/backup" (with only 1 bucket in sketch)
	+ NOTE: remember to set bucket_num in config.ini, otherwise the hashidx will be incorrect sent by phase2 ptf
	+ NOTE: if data in backup is not dirty, it will incur duplicate results for range query -> we leave the deduplication in client-side
		* If data in backup is dirty, it will incur inconsistent results (from KVS and backup) for range query -> we leave it in client-side, i.e., client treats data from backup with higher priority
		* If data in backup with vallen of 0, it is deleted which should not be the result of range query -> we leave the removal of deleted data in client-side
