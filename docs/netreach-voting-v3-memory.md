# Tofino-based NetREACH (voting-based) + DPDK-based XIndex (in-memory KVS) + variable-length key-value pair w/ snapshot (netreach-voting-v3-memory)

- Client calculates op_hdr.hashidx as slot index to reduce 1 stage (similar as OmniMon)
	+ We calculate meta.hashidx for hash partition in switch
- Offload some functions to egress pipeline to reduce stages
- Using 4B for each unit of key instead of 2B to reduce 1 stage
- TODO: If with IP-level fragmentation
	+ Configure MTU
	+ Only process the first fragmented packet, while only check islock for other fragmented packets to recirculate if necessary
	+ NOTE: must be PUTREQ_LARGE, GETRES, GETRES_POP_LARGE
- TODO: in final test, we need to reset DEBUG_ASSERT as 0 
- TODO: Increase MAX_BUFSIZE in helper.h for large value if necessary
- NOTE: We focus on the consistency between in-switch cache and server, i.e., point-in-time consistency
	+ Point-in-time consistency: if cache crashes, server can provide all data before a time point
		+ NetCache uses write-through cache which holds the strictest consistency, i.e., no data loss of cache crashes
		+ Write cache policy (FAST13) provides point-in-time consistency by two strategies, ordered/journaled eviction
		+ Although we use out-of-order eviction between switch and server, we provide crash-consistent snapshot for switch; after collaborating with server-side snapshot, we can achieve point-in-time consistency
	+ We do not consider replication consistency, e.g., linearzability, strong consistency, read-after-write/update/delete
		+ Pegasus focuses on replication consistency as its switch stores replication repository information instead of key-value data
			* It uses switch to manage the update of replications, which must provide replication consistency
		+ However, NetCache and our work should be transparent with server-side replication
			* We support server-side KVS without replication (we can use in-switch cache for load balance)
			* If with replication for fault tolerance, to achieve linearizability
				- For GET, as NetCache and our work block the subsequent writes for the to-be-cached key, both can wait for the complete of uncommitted writes before caching the key 
				- For PUT in NetCache, it lets server to process it which can guarantee linearizablity 
				- For PUT in our work, if it is applied to in-switch cache, we should treat it as committed
					+ We can evict data to each replicaiton node (guaranteed by switch OS) for linearizability
					+ As we may break linearizability during a bounded time, we may achieve weak linearizability or nearly strong consistency
					+ However, as replication should be orthogonal with our design, we should refer to it as availability
- NOTE: we put all register arrays related with availability (or read-after-write consistency) in the same ingress pipeline
	+ Including key, vallen, value, and seq
	+ Reason: RMT keeps FIFO ordering for packets in the same pipeline, yet packets may reorder when coming from ingress to egress
	+ For packets with cache hit, we use the order arriving at the switch (i.e., ingress pipeline); while for those with cache miss, we use the order arriving at the server
- Can we support exactly-once semantics? -> no (large throughput and traffic overhead)
	+ Exactly-once belongs to linearizability which is replication consistency, while we focus on consistency between cache and server
		+ Only Pegasus for replication and Concordia for cache coherence consider it, while both NetCache and DistCache do not 
	+ Although server can store per-client latest req ID to avoid packet duplication for exactly-once semantics, it is hard for switch
		* Clients are dynamically changing, thus we cannot statically allocate resources for them in switch
		* We need to check whether the req has been processed at the beginning of ingress pipeline, while we can only mark the req being processed at the end of egress pipeline -> hard for pipeline programming model
			- Note that before answering response, the client will never send a new req with larger req ID
			- We can recirculate each packet with cache hit to set the req ID for the client at the beginning of ingress pipeline for exactly-once semantics; for the packet with cache miss, we can set the req ID in the ingress pipeline by the corresponding response
			- Issues: (1) frequent recirculation means a half of max throughput; (2) if a duplicate req from the same client arrives at the switch before the recirculated/response packet set the req ID at the ingress pipeline, we still violate exactly-once semantics; (3) if the response packet is lost and duplicate packet has a cache hit, then it will still break exactly-once semantics
				+ For second case, we can set a proper (relatively large) retry timeout to avoid it
				+ For third case, server should maintain a retry mechanism to wait for the ACK from switch -> traffic overhead

## Overview

- Design features
	+ Parameter-free decision
		* Existing: large parameter -> miss hot keys; small parameter -> too many hot keys -> insufficient cache capacity and switch OS bottleneck
		* Challenge: Slow warmup with incast populations -> data-plane-based cache population
			- NOTE: Mirroring GETRES_POP_EVICT/PUTREQ_POP_EVICT does not incur switch OS bottleneck since we do not need send old key-value pair
			to server if the entry is invalid during warmup phase
	+ Data-plane-based cache update
		* Data-plane-based value update
		* Data-plane-based cache population
			- GETREQ: response-based cache population
			- PUTREQ: recirculation-based cache population
			- Atomicity: 
				+ Use lock bit + recirculation-based blocking
				+ Use seq to cope with packet reordering of PUT
				+ Controller periodically checks lock bit to cope with rare packet loss
			- NOTE: recirculation is acceptable
				+ We do not block normal packets
				+ NetReach packets must be hashed into the same slot with different keys of currently cached one
				+ Population time is limited: us-level for GET and ns-level for PUT
				+ # of blocked packets is limited by # of clients (e.g., one thread in a host) due to one-by-one pattern of NetReach client library
			- NOTE: recirculation-based blocking guarantees that version of switch >= server
	+ Crash-consistent backup
		* Case 1: change on in-switch cache value;
		* Case 2: change on in-switch cache key-value pair;
		* Case 3: change on server KVS for range query;
	+ CBF-based fast path
		* In LSM-based KVS, as data is very large, we can only maintain CBF for buffer and buffer_temp
		* Now we focus on in-memory KVS where data can fit into memory, so we can directly maintain CBF for data array
			- As we keep group merge/split and model merge/split, we cannot free data, buffer, and CBF in deconstructor
	+ TODO: Others
		* Range query support
		* Switch-driven consistent hashing
		* Distributed extension
- Term routine
	+ Match: just compare without 
	+ Get: load to change packet header field (or metadata field)
	+ Set: store new value without changing packet header field
	+ Set_and_get: store new value and change packet header field with old value
	+ Reset: reset value as 0
	+ Init: initialize value as 1
- NOTES
	+ TODO: we need to verify the liimted bandwidth overhead of switch OS (case1, mirrored evict/case2, backup data)
	+ TODO: we need to verify the limited recirculation rate due to data-plane-based eviction
		* We can clone a pkt for each recirculation to cound the # of recirculations, then divide it with # of pkts
		* Note that one packet has only one recirculation if locked by PUTREQ_POP, while multiple recirculations if by GETRES_POP

## Details 

- Packet format
	+ op_hdr: 1B optype, 2B hashidx, 16B key
	+ val_hdr: 4B vallen, variable-length value
		* If value <= 128B, align with 8B (only when serializing/deserializing to/from packet, invisible to client)
		* If value > 128B, do not need alignment
- Client-side processing
	+ Client side calculates hash into op_hdr.hashidx
	+ Only GET and PUT are related with value length, while DEL does not care
		* GET is processed by server for GETREQ_POP: if value>128B, return GETRES_POP_LARGE that behaves similar as GETRES_NPOP in switch
		* For PUT, client sends PUTREQ_LARGE if value>128B, which does not update vote, and may invalidate and evict in-switch item
			- If with invalidation/eviction (i.e., becoming PUTREQ_LARGE_EVICT and clone a PUTREQ_LARGE), PUTREQ_LARGE_EVICT will be mirrored to switch OS to cope with packet loss
- In-switch processing
	+ NOTE: clone_i2e clones the original packet to egress pipeline; clone_e2e clones the deparsed packet to egress pipeline
	+ Overview
		* Stage 0: keylolo, keylohi, keyhilo, keyhihi, load_backup_tbl
			- For key, we provide two operations: match, set_and_get
		* Stage 1: valid, vote, seq (assign for each PUTREQ/DELREQ/PUTREQ_LARGE), update_iskeymatch_tbl
			- To avoid seq overflow, we can maintain an array of seq, each for a value in the hash range of key (i.e. a hash slot)
				+ NOTE: # of seq does not need to equal with # of cache, as we only need to compare seq for the same key
					* It guarantees that for each key, seq always increases (server uses 0 as initial value, while switch starts from 1)
				+ Another way is to use more bits and stages for seq (we do not use due to stage limitation)
					* For example, we can use a 64-bit register array for seq (register_hi for highest 32 bits, while register_lo for lowest 32 bits)
					* Due to lack of comparator within each ALU, we must maintain savedseq_hi and savedseq_lo in two 32-bit register arrays, which wastes stage
				+ NOTE: the following packets have seq_hdr
					* PUTREQ_POP
				+ TODO: both GETRES_POP, PUTREQ_POP, and evicted packets needs to set savedseq correspondingly
					* TODO: Note that for GETRES_POP which carries savedseq from server, if new PUT/DEL arrives at switch after GETRES_POP is applied into switch, the assigned seq must be larger than that carried from server
				+ TODO: server also needs to save the seq number, which should be invisible to client
		* Stage 2: savedseq, lock 
			- For PUTREQ/DELREQ/PUTREQ_RECIR/DELREQ_RECIR, if iskeymatch=1, try_update_savedseq: if seq<=savedseq, directly send back response; otherwise, update vallen and value before sending back response
			- TODO: For PUTREQ_POP/DELREQ_POP, set_and_get_savedseq: set savedseq=seq_hdr.seq, and get old savedseq into seq_hdr.seq
				+ NOTE: original packet can use seq_hdr.seq (old) for eviction, yet cloned packet does not need seq due to for response 

		* Stage 3: vallen, vallo1, valhi1, case12
			- For vallen and val, we provide two operations: get, set_and_get
		* Stage 4-10: from val2 to val15
		* Stage 11: vallo16, valhi16, ~~case3~~, port_forward_tbl
		* Egress pipeline

					+ For CASE2, switch OS not only performs rollback for snapshot, but also sends to server by tcp for packet loss
					+ For each packet received from switch OS, server can compare the carried seq with the saved one to avoid overwrite

- Support normal packets (packet_format.\*, ycsb_remote_client.c, ycsb_server.c, iniparser_wrapper.\*, deleted_set.\*)
	+ Suport 9 types of GET: GETREQ, GETREQ_RECIR, GETRES from server, GETREQ_POP, GETRES_POP, GETRES_NPOP, GETRES_POP_LARGE, GETRES from switch, GETRES_POP_EVICT, GETRES_POP_EVICT_CASE2
	+ Support 13 types of PUT: PUTREQ, PUTREQ_RECIR, PUTRES from server, PUTREQ_POP, PUTREQ_POP_EVICT, PUTREQ_POP_EVICT_CASE2, PUTRES from switch, PUTREQ_CASE3, PUTREQ_LARGE, PUTREQ_LARGE_RECIR, PUTREQ_LARGE_EVICT, PUTREQ_LARGE_EVICT_CASE2

	+ Support 5 types of DEL: DELREQ, DELRES from server, DELREQ_RECIR, DELRES from switch
		* TODO: DELREQ_CASE1, DELREQ_CASE3
		* Implement DELREQ in server-side
	+ Support 8 types for switch OS: PUT/DELREQ_CASE1, GETRES_POP_EVICT/CASE2, PUTREQ_POP_EVICT/CASE2, PUTREQ_LARGE_EVICT/CASE2
- Implement switch OS thread
	+ Support PUT/DELREQ_CASE1
	+ Support EVICT: GETRES_POP_EVICT, PUTREQ_POP_EVICT, and PUTREQ_LARGE_POP_EVICT
	+ Support CASE2: GETRES_POP_EVICT_CASE2, PUTREQ_POP_EVICT_CASE2, and PUTREQ_LARGE_POP_EVICT_CASE2
	+ Maintain one special case list is enough
		* In design, switch os only writes the special case list before the end of current snapshot period, and it only reads the special case list after the end of current snapshot period
		* In simulation: only switch os thread writes the special case list before receiving the snapshot data, and only backuper reads the special case list after receiving the snapshot data to perform rollback
- Implement design for packet loss
	+ Switch OS retry by tcp channel
	+ Seq mechanism
		* NOTE: seq is genreated by switch which is in big-endian
		* PUTREQ/PUTREQ_RECIR -> PUTREQ_POP (new seq), PUTREQ_RECIR (new seq), PUTREQ_SEQ (new seq; PUTREQ forwarded to server)

## How to run

- Prepare for YCSB
	- Prepare workload for loading or transaction phase
		+ For example:
		+ `./bin/ycsb.sh load basic -P workloads/workloada -P netbuffer.dat > workloada-load.out`
		+ `./bin/ycsb.sh run basic -P workloads/workloada -P netbuffer.dat > workloada-run.out`
		+ `./split_workload load`
		+ `./split_workload run`
- Server
	- `./ycsb_local_client` for loading phase
	- `./ycsb_server` for server-side in transaction phase
- Client
	- `./ycsb_remote_client` for client-side in transaction phase
- Switch
	- Run `cd tofino`
	+ Run `su` to enter root account
	+ Run `bash compile.sh` to compile p4 into binary code
	+ Run `bash start_switch.sh` to launch Tofino
	+ Create a new terminal and run `bash configure.sh` to configure data plane
	+ `bash controller.sh setup`
	+ END: `bash controller.sh cleanup`
- Directory structure
	+ Raw workload file: workloada-load.out, workloada-run.out
	+ Split workload file: e.g., workloada-load-5/2.out
	+ Database directory: e.g., /tmp/netbuffer/workloada/group0.db, /tmp/netbuffer/workloada/buffer0-0.db
	+ RMI model at root node when init key-value store: workloada-root.out

## Simple test

- NOTE: update bucket_num in config.ini as 1 before test
- Test cases of normal operations: See directory of "testcases/normal" (with only 1 bucket in sketch)
	+ Case 1: single read (GET evicts invalid)
		* Read the value of a given key
		* It should read the value from the server and also store it in switch
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val, seq = 0, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1
	+ Case 2: single write (PUT evicts invalid)
		* Write new value for a given key
		* It should write the value into switch by recirculation and sendback PUTRES (no PUTREQ_POP)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val, seq = 1, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1
	+ Case 3: read-after-write
		* Write value of k1 and then read k1
		* It should write the value in switch and read the value from switch (not touch server)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k1, seq = 1, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 2
	+ Case 4: read-after-two-writes
		* Write value of k1 twice, and then read k1
		* It should write the value in switch and read the value from switch (not touch server)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k1, seq = 2, savedseq = 2, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 3
	+ Case 5: write-after-read1
		* Read value of k1 and then write k1
		* It reads the value of k1 from server and store it in switch, PUT increases vote, updates vallen & val, and does not touch server
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k1, seq = 1, savedseq = 1, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 2
	+ Case 6: write-after-read2
		* Read value of k1 and then write k2
		* It should read the value of k1 from server and store it in switch, k2 will decrease vote and be forwarded to server (no cache update)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k1, seq = 1, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 0
	+ Case 7: two-writes-after-read (PUT evicts GET)
		* Read value of k1 and then write k2 twice
		* It should read the value of k1 from server and store it in switch, k2 will replace k1 finally (PUTs touch server only once)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of 2nd k2, seq = 2, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1
	+ Case 8: read-after-two-writes-after-write (PUT evicts PUT)
		* Write value of k1, write k2 twice, and then read k2
		* PUT of k1 writes the value in switch and sendback PUTRES, 1st PUT of k2 is forwarded to server, 2nd PUT of k2 evicts k1, GET
		is directly processed by switch
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of 2nd k2, seq = 3, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 2
	+ Case 9: two-reads-after-write (GET evicts PUT)
		* Write value of k1, read k2 twice
		* It writes value of k1 in switch, GETs of k2 evicted k1 (the evicted data touches server)
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k2, seq = 1, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1
	+ Case 10: two-reads-after-read (GET evicts GET)
		* Read value of k1, read k2 twice
		* It first gets value of k1 from server and stores it in switch, the 2nd GET of k2 replaces k1 in switch
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen, and val of k2, seq = 0, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 1
	+ Case 11: read-delete-read
		* Read value of k1, delete k1, and then read k1 again
		* It first gets value of k1 from server and stores it in switch, then it deletes k1 (set vallen=0 without changing valid and vote), the 2nd GET
		of k1 gets a value of size 0 
		* In-switch result: non-zero key, vallen=0, and val of k1, seq = 0, savedseq = 0, lock = 0, valid = 1, vote = 2
- Test cases of crash-consistent backup and range query: See "testcases/backup" (with only 1 bucket in sketch)
	+ NOTE: remember to set bucket_num in config.ini, otherwise the hashidx will be incorrect sent by phase2 ptf
	+ NOTE: if data in backup is not dirty, it will incur duplicate results for range query -> we leave the deduplication in client-side
		* If data in backup is dirty, it will incur inconsistent results (from KVS and backup) for range query -> we leave it in client-side, i.e., client treats data from backup with higher priority
		* If data in backup with vallen of 0, it is deleted which should not be the result of range query -> we leave the removal of deleted data in client-side
