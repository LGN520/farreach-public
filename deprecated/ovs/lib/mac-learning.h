/* MAC learning table
 * ==================
 *
 * A MAC learning table is a dictionary data structure that is specialized to
 * map from an (Ethernet address, VLAN ID) pair to a user-provided pointer.  In
 * an Ethernet switch implementation, it used to keep track of the port on
 * which a packet from a given Ethernet address was last seen.  This knowledge
 * is useful when the switch receives a packet to such an Ethernet address, so
 * that the switch can send the packet directly to the correct port instead of
 * having to flood it to every port.
 *
 * A few complications make the implementation into more than a simple wrapper
 * around a hash table.  First, and most simply, MAC learning can be disabled
 * on a per-VLAN basis. (This is most useful for RSPAN; see
 * ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) documentation of the "output_vlan" column in the
 * Mirror table for more information.).  The data structure maintains a bitmap
 * to track such VLANs.
 *
 * Second, the implementation has the ability to "lock" a MAC table entry
 * updated by a gratuitous ARP.  This is a simple feature but the rationale for
 * it is complicated.  Refer to the description of SLB bonding in the
 * 'ovs-vswitchd Internals' guide for an explanation.
 *
 * Third, the implementation expires entries that are idle for longer than a
 * configurable amount of time.  This is implemented by keeping all of the
 * current table entries on a list ordered from least recently used (LRU) to
 * most recently used (MRU).  Each time a MAC entry is used, it is moved to the
 * MRU end of the list.  Periodically mac_learning_run() sweeps through the
 * list starting from the LRU end, deleting each entry that has been idle too
 * long.
 *
 * Finally, the number of MAC learning table entries has a configurable maximum
 * size to prevent memory exhaustion.  When a new entry must be inserted but
 * the table is already full, the implementation uses an eviction strategy
 * based on fairness: it chooses the port that currently has greatest number of
 * learned MACs (choosing arbitrarily in case of a tie), and among that port's
 * entries it evicts the least recently used.  (This is a security feature
 * because it prevents an attacker from forcing other ports' MACs out of the
 * MAC learning table with a "MAC flooding attack" that causes the other ports'
 * traffic to be flooded so that the attacker can easily sniff it.)  The
 * implementation of this feature is like a specialized form of the
 * general-purpose "eviction groups" that OVS implements in OpenFlow (see the
 * documentation of the "groups" column in the Flow_Table table in
 * ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for details).
 *
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * Many operations require the caller to take the MAC learning table's rwlock
 * for writing (please refer to the Clang thread safety annotations).  The
 * important exception to this is mac_learning_lookup(), which only needs a
 * read lock.  This is useful for the common case where a MAC learning entry
 * being looked up already exists and does not need an update.  However,
 * there's no deadlock-free way to upgrade a read lock to a write lock, so in
 * the case where the lookup result means that an update is required, the
 * caller must drop the read lock, take the write lock, and then repeat the
 * lookup (in case some other thread has already made a change).
