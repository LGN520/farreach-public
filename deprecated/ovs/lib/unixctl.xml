  <dd>
    Sets the name of the control socket on which
    <code><var>program</var></code> listens for runtime management commands
    (see <var>RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS,</var> below).  If <var>socket</var>
    does not begin with <code>/</code>, it is interpreted as relative to
    <code>@RUNDIR@</code>. If <code>--unixctl</code> is not used at all,
    the default socket is
    <code>@RUNDIR@/<var>program</var>.</code><var>pid</var><code>.ctl</code>,
    where <var>pid</var> is <code><var>program</var></code>'s process ID.
  <p>
    On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime management
    commands.  A file is created in the absolute path as pointed by
    <var>socket</var> or if <code>--unixctl</code> is not used at all,
    a file is created as <code><var>program</var></code> in the configured
    <var>OVS_RUNDIR</var> directory.  The file exists just to mimic the
    behavior of a Unix domain socket.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifying <code>none</code> for <var>socket</var> disables the control
    socket feature.
