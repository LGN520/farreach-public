.SH NAME
ovs\-vsctl \- utility for querying and configuring \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand
\fR[\fIargs\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand \fR[\fIargs\fR]]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovs\-vsctl\fR program configures \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR(8) by
providing a high\-level interface to its configuration database.
See \fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for comprehensive documentation of
the database schema.
.PP
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR connects to an \fBovsdb\-server\fR process that
maintains an Open vSwitch configuration database.  Using this
connection, it queries and possibly applies changes to the database,
depending on the supplied commands.  Then, if it applied any changes,
by default it waits until \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR has finished
reconfiguring itself before it exits.  (If you use \fBovs\-vsctl\fR
when \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is not running, use \fB\-\-no\-wait\fR.)
.PP
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR can perform any number of commands in a single run,
implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.
.PP
The \fBovs\-vsctl\fR command line begins with global options (see
\fBOPTIONS\fR below for details).  The global options are followed by
one or more commands.  Each command should begin with \fB\-\-\fR by
itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from the following
commands.  (The \fB\-\-\fR before the first command is optional.)  The
command
itself starts with command-specific options, if any, followed by the
command name and any arguments.  See \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for syntax
examples.
.
.SS "Linux VLAN Bridging Compatibility"
The \fBovs\-vsctl\fR program supports the model of a bridge
implemented by Open vSwitch, in which a single bridge supports ports
on multiple VLANs.  In this model, each port on a bridge is either a
trunk port that potentially passes packets tagged with 802.1Q headers
that designate VLANs or it is assigned a single implicit VLAN that is
never tagged with an 802.1Q header.
.PP
For compatibility with software designed for the Linux bridge,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR also supports a model in which traffic associated
with a given 802.1Q VLAN is segregated into a separate bridge.  A
special form of the \fBadd\-br\fR command (see below) creates a ``fake
bridge'' within an Open vSwitch bridge to simulate this behavior.
When such a ``fake bridge'' is active, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will treat it
much like a bridge separate from its ``parent bridge,'' but the actual
implementation in Open vSwitch uses only a single bridge, with ports on
the fake bridge assigned the implicit VLAN of the fake bridge of which
they are members.  (A fake bridge for VLAN 0 receives packets that
have no 802.1Q tag or a tag with VLAN 0.)
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
The following options affect the behavior \fBovs\-vsctl\fR as a whole.
Some individual commands also accept their own options, which are
given just before the command name.  If the first command on the
command line has options, then those options must be separated from
the global options by \fB\-\-\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-db=\fIserver\fR"
Sets \fIserver\fR as the database server that \fBovs\-vsctl\fR
contacts to query or modify configuration.  \fIserver\fR may be an
OVSDB active or passive connection method, as described in
\fBovsdb\fR(7).  The default is \fBunix:@RUNDIR@/db.sock\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-wait\fR"
Prevents \fBovs\-vsctl\fR from waiting for \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR to
reconfigure itself according to the modified database.  This
option should be used if \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is not running;
otherwise, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will not exit until \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
starts.
.IP
This option has no effect if the commands specified do not change the
database.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-syslog\fR"
By default, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR logs its arguments and the details of any
changes that it makes to the system log.  This option disables this
logging.
.IP
This option is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose=vsctl:syslog:warn\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-oneline\fR"
Modifies the output format so that the output for each command is printed
on a single line.  New-line characters that would otherwise separate
lines are printed as \fB\\n\fR, and any instances of \fB\\\fR that
would otherwise appear in the output are doubled.
Prints a blank line for each command that has no output.
This option does not affect the formatting of output from the
\fBlist\fR or \fBfind\fR commands; see \fBTable Formatting Options\fR
below.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR"
Prevents \fBovs\-vsctl\fR from actually modifying the database.
.
.IP "\fB\-t \fIsecs\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-timeout=\fIsecs\fR"
By default, or with a \fIsecs\fR of \fB0\fR, \fBovs\-vsctl\fR waits
forever for a response from the database.  This option limits runtime
to approximately \fIsecs\fR seconds.  If the timeout expires,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR will exit with a \fBSIGALRM\fR signal.  (A timeout
would normally happen only if the database cannot be contacted, or if
the system is overloaded.)
.
.IP "\fB\-\-retry\fR"
Without this option, if \fBovs\-vsctl\fR connects outward to the
database server (the default) then \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will try to
connect once and exit with an error if the connection fails (which
usually means that \fBovsdb\-server\fR is not running).
.IP
With this option, or if \fB\-\-db\fR specifies that \fBovs\-vsctl\fR
should listen for an incoming connection from the database server,
then \fBovs\-vsctl\fR will wait for a connection to the database
forever.
.IP
Regardless of this setting, \fB\-\-timeout\fR always limits how long
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR will wait.
.
.SS "Table Formatting Options"
These options control the format of output from the \fBlist\fR and
\fBfind\fR commands.

.SH COMMANDS
The commands implemented by \fBovs\-vsctl\fR are described in the
sections below.
.SS "Open vSwitch Commands"
These commands work with an Open vSwitch as a whole.
.
.IP "\fBinit\fR"
Initializes the Open vSwitch database, if it is empty.  If the
database has already been initialized, this command has no effect.
.IP
Any successful \fBovs\-vsctl\fR command automatically initializes the
Open vSwitch database if it is empty.  This command is provided to
initialize the database without executing any other command.
.
.IP "\fBshow\fR"
Prints a brief overview of the database contents.
.
.IP "\fBemer\-reset\fR"
Reset the configuration into a clean state.  It deconfigures OpenFlow
controllers, OVSDB servers, and SSL, and deletes port mirroring,
\fBfail_mode\fR, NetFlow, sFlow, and IPFIX configuration.  This
command also removes all \fBother\-config\fR keys from all database
records, except that \fBother\-config:hwaddr\fR is preserved if it is
present in a Bridge record.  Other networking configuration is left
as-is.
.
.SS "Bridge Commands"
These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch bridges.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-br \fIbridge\fR"
Creates a new bridge named \fIbridge\fR.  Initially the bridge will
have no ports (other than \fIbridge\fR itself).
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a bridge that
exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does
nothing if \fIbridge\fR already exists as a real bridge.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-br \fIbridge parent vlan\fR"
Creates a ``fake bridge'' named \fIbridge\fR within the existing Open
vSwitch bridge \fIparent\fR, which must already exist and must not
itself be a fake bridge.  The new fake bridge will be on 802.1Q VLAN
\fIvlan\fR, which must be an integer between 0 and 4095.  The parent
bridge must not already have a fake bridge for \fIvlan\fR.  Initially
\fIbridge\fR will have no ports (other than \fIbridge\fR itself).
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a bridge that
exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does
nothing if \fIbridge\fR already exists as a VLAN bridge under
\fIparent\fR for \fIvlan\fR.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-br \fIbridge\fR"
Deletes \fIbridge\fR and all of its ports.  If \fIbridge\fR is a real
bridge, this command also deletes any fake bridges that were created
with \fIbridge\fR as parent, including all of their ports.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a bridge that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a bridge that does not exist has no effect.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-real\fR|\fB\-\-fake\fR] \fBlist\-br\fR"
Lists all existing real and fake bridges on standard output, one per
line.  With \fB\-\-real\fR or \fB\-\-fake\fR, only bridges of that type
are returned.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-exists \fIbridge\fR"
Tests whether \fIbridge\fR exists as a real or fake bridge.  If so,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR exits successfully with exit code 0.  If not,
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR exits unsuccessfully with exit code 2.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-to\-vlan \fIbridge\fR"
If \fIbridge\fR is a fake bridge, prints the bridge's 802.1Q VLAN as a
decimal integer.  If \fIbridge\fR is a real bridge, prints 0.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-to\-parent \fIbridge\fR"
If \fIbridge\fR is a fake bridge, prints the name of its parent
bridge.  If \fIbridge\fR is a real bridge, print \fIbridge\fR.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-set\-external\-id \fIbridge key\fR [\fIvalue\fR]"
Sets or clears an ``external ID'' value on \fIbridge\fR.  These values
are intended to identify entities external to Open vSwitch with which
\fIbridge\fR is associated, e.g. the bridge's identifier in a
virtualization management platform.  The Open vSwitch database schema
specifies well-known \fIkey\fR values, but \fIkey\fR and \fIvalue\fR
are otherwise arbitrary strings.
.IP
If \fIvalue\fR is specified, then \fIkey\fR is set to \fIvalue\fR for
\fIbridge\fR, overwriting any previous value.  If \fIvalue\fR is
omitted, then \fIkey\fR is removed from \fIbridge\fR's set of external
IDs (if it was present).
.IP
For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to that of a
\fBset\fR or \fBremove\fR command in the \fBexternal\-ids\fR column of
the \fBBridge\fR table.  For fake bridges, it actually modifies keys
with names prefixed by \fBfake\-bridge\-\fR in the \fBPort\fR table.
.
.IP "\fBbr\-get\-external\-id \fIbridge\fR [\fIkey\fR]"
Queries the external IDs on \fIbridge\fR.  If \fIkey\fR is specified,
the output is the value for that \fIkey\fR or the empty string if
\fIkey\fR is unset.  If \fIkey\fR is omitted, the output is
\fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR, one per line, for each key-value pair.
.IP
For real bridges, the effect of this command is similar to that of a
\fBget\fR command in the \fBexternal\-ids\fR column of the
\fBBridge\fR table.  For fake bridges, it queries keys with names
prefixed by \fBfake\-bridge\-\fR in the \fBPort\fR table.
.
.SS "Port Commands"
.
These commands examine and manipulate Open vSwitch ports.  These
commands treat a bonded port as a single entity.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-ports \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all of the ports within \fIbridge\fR on standard output, one per
line.  The local port \fIbridge\fR is not included in the list.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-port \fIbridge port \fR[\fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR]\fR=\fIvalue\fR]\&...\fR"
Creates on \fIbridge\fR a new port named \fIport\fR from the network
device of the same name.
.IP
Optional arguments set values of column in the Port record created by
the command.  For example, \fBtag=9\fR would make the port an access
port for VLAN 9.  The syntax is the same as that for the \fBset\fR
command (see \fBDatabase Commands\fR below).
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a port that exists
is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does nothing if
\fIport\fR already exists on \fIbridge\fR and is not a bonded port.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-port \fR[\fIbridge\fR] \fIport\fR"
Deletes \fIport\fR.  If \fIbridge\fR is omitted, \fIport\fR is removed
from whatever bridge contains it; if \fIbridge\fR is specified, it
must be the real or fake bridge that contains \fIport\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a port that does
not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a port that does not exist has no effect.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fB\-\-with\-iface del\-port \fR[\fIbridge\fR] \fIiface\fR"
Deletes the port named \fIiface\fR or that has an interface named
\fIiface\fR.  If \fIbridge\fR is omitted, the port is removed from
whatever bridge contains it; if \fIbridge\fR is specified, it must be
the real or fake bridge that contains the port.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete the port for an
interface that does not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR,
attempting to delete the port for an interface that does not exist has
no effect.
.
.IP "\fBport\-to\-br \fIport\fR"
Prints the name of the bridge that contains \fIport\fR on standard
output.
.
.SS "Bond Commands"
.
These commands work with ports that have more than one interface,
which Open vSwitch calls ``bonds.''
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-fake\-iface\fR] \fBadd\-bond \fIbridge port iface\fR\&... [\fIcolumn\fR[\fB:\fIkey\fR]\fR=\fIvalue\fR]\&...\fR"
Creates on \fIbridge\fR a new port named \fIport\fR that bonds
together the network devices given as each \fIiface\fR.  At least two
interfaces must be named.  If the interfaces are DPDK enabled then
the transaction will need to include operations to explicitly set the
interface type to 'dpdk'.
.IP
Optional arguments set values of column in the Port record created by
the command.  The syntax is the same as that for the \fBset\fR command
(see \fBDatabase Commands\fR below).
.IP
With \fB\-\-fake\-iface\fR, a fake interface with the name \fIport\fR is
created.  This should only be used for compatibility with legacy
software that requires it.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to create a port that exists
is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, this command does nothing if
\fIport\fR already exists on \fIbridge\fR and bonds together exactly
the specified interfaces.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-bond\-iface \fIbond iface\fR"
Adds \fIiface\fR as a new bond interface to the existing port
\fIbond\fR.  If \fIbond\fR previously had only one port, this
transforms it into a bond.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to add an \fIiface\fR that is
already part of \fIbond\fR is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR,
this command does nothing if \fIiface\fR is already part of
\fIbond\fR.  (It is still an error if \fIiface\fR is an interface of
some other port or bond.)
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-bond\-iface\fR [\fIbond\fR] \fIiface\fR"
Removes \fIiface\fR from its port.  If \fIbond\fR is omitted,
\fIiface\fR is removed from whatever port contains it; if \fIbond\fR
is specified, it must be the port that contains \fIbond\fR.
.IP
If removing \fIiface\fR causes its port to have only a single
interface, then that port transforms from a bond into an ordinary
port.  It is an error if \fIiface\fR is the only interface in its
port.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete an interface that
does not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete an interface that does not exist has no effect.
.
.SS "Interface Commands"
.
These commands examine the interfaces attached to an Open vSwitch
bridge.  These commands treat a bonded port as a collection of two or
more interfaces, rather than as a single port.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-ifaces \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all of the interfaces within \fIbridge\fR on standard output,
one per line.  The local port \fIbridge\fR is not included in the
list.
.
.IP "\fBiface\-to\-br \fIiface\fR"
Prints the name of the bridge that contains \fIiface\fR on standard
output.
.
.SS "Conntrack Zone Commands"
These commands query and modify datapath CT zones and Timeout Policies.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-may\-exist\fR] \fBadd\-zone\-tp \fIdatapath \fBzone=\fIzone_id \fIpolicies\fR"
Creates a conntrack zone timeout policy with \fIzone_id\fR in
\fIdatapath\fR.  The \fIpolicies\fR consist of \fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR
pairs, separated by spaces.  For example, \fBicmp_first=30
icmp_reply=60\fR specifies a 30-second timeout policy for the first ICMP
packet and a 60-second policy for ICMP reply packets.  See the
\fBCT_Timeout_Policy\fR table in \fBovs-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for the
supported keys.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR, attempting to add a \fIzone_id\fR that
already exists is an error.  With \fB\-\-may\-exist\fR,
this command does nothing if \fIzone_id\fR already exists.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-if\-exists\fR] \fBdel\-zone\-tp \fIdatapath \fBzone=\fIzone_id\fR"
Delete the timeout policy associated with \fIzone_id\fR from \fIdatapath\fR.
.IP
Without \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to delete a zone that
does not exist is an error.  With \fB\-\-if\-exists\fR, attempting to
delete a zone that does not exist has no effect.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-zone\-tp \fIdatapath\fR"
Prints the timeout policies of all zones in \fIdatapath\fR.
.
.SS "Datapath Capabilities Command"
The command query datapath capabilities.
.
.IP "\fBlist\-dp\-cap \fIdatapath\fR"
Prints the datapath's capabilities.
.
.SS "OpenFlow Controller Connectivity"
.
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR can perform all configured bridging and switching
locally, or it can be configured to communicate with one or more
external OpenFlow controllers.  The switch is typically configured to
connect to a primary controller that takes charge of the bridge's flow
table to implement a network policy.  In addition, the switch can be
configured to listen to connections from service controllers.  Service
controllers are typically used for occasional support and maintenance,
e.g. with \fBovs\-ofctl\fR.
.
.IP "\fBget\-controller\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Prints the configured controller target.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-controller\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Deletes the configured controller target.
.
.IP "\fBset\-controller\fR \fIbridge\fR \fItarget\fR\&..."
Sets the configured controller target or targets.  Each \fItarget\fR may
use any of the following forms:
.
.RS
.so lib/vconn-active.man
.so lib/vconn-passive.man
.RE
.
.ST "Controller Failure Settings"
.PP
When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible for
setting up all flows on the switch.  Thus, if the connection to
the controller fails, no new network connections can be set up.  If
the connection to the controller stays down long enough, no packets
can pass through the switch at all.
.PP
If the value is \fBstandalone\fR, or if neither of these settings
is set, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will take over
responsibility for setting up
flows when no message has been received from the controller for three
times the inactivity probe interval.  In this mode,
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR causes the datapath to act like an ordinary
MAC-learning switch.  \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will continue to retry connecting
to the controller in the background and, when the connection succeeds,
it discontinues its standalone behavior.
.PP
If this option is set to \fBsecure\fR, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will not
set up flows on its own when the controller connection fails.
.
.IP "\fBget\-fail\-mode\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Prints the configured failure mode.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-fail\-mode\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Deletes the configured failure mode.
.
.IP "\fBset\-fail\-mode\fR \fIbridge\fR \fBstandalone\fR|\fBsecure\fR"
Sets the configured failure mode.
.
.SS "Manager Connectivity"
.
These commands manipulate the \fBmanager_options\fR column in the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table and rows in the \fBManagers\fR table.  When
\fBovsdb\-server\fR is configured to use the \fBmanager_options\fR column for
OVSDB connections (as described in the startup scripts provided with
Open vSwitch; the corresponding \fBovsdb\-server\fR command option is
\fB--remote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options\fR), this allows the
administrator to use \fBovs\-vsctl\fR to configure database connections.
.
.IP "\fBget\-manager\fR"
Prints the configured manager(s).
.
.IP "\fBdel\-manager\fR"
Deletes the configured manager(s).
.
.IP "\fBset\-manager\fR \fItarget\fR\&..."
Sets the configured manager target or targets.
Each \fItarget\fR may be an OVSDB active or passive connection method,
e.g. \fBpssl:6640\fR, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7).
.
.SS "SSL Configuration"
When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is configured to connect over SSL for management or
controller connectivity, the following parameters are required:
.TP
\fIprivate-key\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as the virtual
switch's identity for SSL connections to the controller.
.TP
\fIcertificate\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the
certificate authority (CA) used by the controller and manager, that
certifies the virtual switch's private key, identifying a trustworthy
switch.
.TP
\fIca-cert\fR
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify that
the virtual switch is connected to a trustworthy controller.
.PP
These files are read only once, at \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR startup time.  If
their contents change, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR must be killed and restarted.
.PP
These SSL settings apply to all SSL connections made by the virtual
switch.
.
.IP "\fBget\-ssl\fR"
Prints the SSL configuration.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-ssl\fR"
Deletes the current SSL configuration.
.
.IP "[\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR] \fBset\-ssl\fR \fIprivate-key\fR \fIcertificate\fR \fIca-cert\fR"
Sets the SSL configuration.  The \fB\-\-bootstrap\fR option is described
below.
.
.ST "CA Certificate Bootstrap"
.PP
Ordinarily, all of the files named in the SSL configuration must exist
when \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts.  However, if the \fIca-cert\fR file
does not exist and the \fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
option is given, then \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will attempt to obtain the
CA certificate from the controller on its first SSL connection and
save it to the named PEM file.  If it is successful, it will
immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then on all
SSL connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by the
CA certificate thus obtained.
.PP
\fBThis option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-the-middle
attack obtaining the initial CA certificate\fR, but it may be useful
for bootstrapping.
.PP
This option is only useful if the controller sends its CA certificate
as part of the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol does not
require the controller to send the CA certificate.
.
.SS "Auto-Attach Commands"
.
The IETF Auto-Attach SPBM draft standard describes a compact method of using
IEEE 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE 802.1aq
Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically attach network devices to
individual services in a SPB network.  The intent here is to allow network
applications and devices using OVS to be able to easily take advantage of
features offered by industry standard SPB networks. A fundamental element of
the Auto-Attach feature is to map traditional VLANs onto SPB I_SIDs. These
commands manage the Auto-Attach I-SID/VLAN mappings.
.
.IP "\fBadd\-aa\-mapping \fIbridge i-sid vlan\fR"
Creates a new Auto-Attach mapping on \fIbridge\fR for \fIi-sid\fR
and \fIvlan\fR.
.
.IP "\fBdel\-aa\-mapping \fIbridge i-sid vlan\fR"
Deletes an Auto-Attach mapping on \fIbridge\fR for \fIi-sid\fR
and \fIvlan\fR.
.IP "\fBget\-aa\-mapping \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all of the Auto-Attach mappings within \fIbridge\fR on standard output.
.
.SS "Database Commands"
.
These commands query and modify the contents of \fBovsdb\fR tables.
They are a slight abstraction of the \fBovsdb\fR interface and as such
they operate at a lower level than other \fBovs\-vsctl\fR commands.
.PP
.ST "Identifying Tables, Records, and Columns"
.PP
Each of these commands has a \fItable\fR parameter to identify a table
within the database.  Many of them also take a \fIrecord\fR parameter
that identifies a particular record within a table.  The \fIrecord\fR
parameter may be the UUID for a record, and many tables offer
additional ways to identify records.  Some commands also take
\fIcolumn\fR parameters that identify a particular field within the
records in a table.
.PP
For a list of tables and their columns, see \fBovs-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) or
see the table listing from the \fB--help\fR option.
.PP
Record names must be specified in full and with correct
capitalization, except that UUIDs may be abbreviated to their first 4
(or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within the table.
Names of tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and \fB\-\fR and
\fB_\fR are treated interchangeably.  Unique abbreviations of table
and column names are acceptable, e.g. \fBnet\fR or \fBn\fR is
sufficient to identify the \fBNetFlow\fR table.

.SS "Port Mirroring"
.PP
Mirror all packets received or sent on \fBeth0\fR or \fBeth1\fR onto
\fBeth2\fR, assuming that all of those ports exist on bridge \fBbr0\fR
(as a side-effect this causes any packets received on \fBeth2\fR to be
ignored):

.B "ovs\-vsctl clear Port eth1 qos"
.PP
To deconfigure the QoS record from both \fBeth0\fR and \fBeth1\fR and
then delete the QoS record (which must be done explicitly because
unreferenced QoS records are not automatically destroyed):
.IP
.B "ovs\-vsctl \-\- destroy QoS eth0 \-\- clear Port eth0 qos \-\- clear Port eth1 qos"

their UUIDs, then "\fBovs\-vsctl destroy Queue \fIuuid1\fR
\fIuuid2\fR" to destroy each of them or use
