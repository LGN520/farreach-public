# XIndex

XIndex is a concurrent and flexible learned index library. It includes a concurrent learned range index [XIndex-R](./XIndex-R) and a concurrent learned hash index [XIndex-H](./XIndex-H). It also provides optimizations to efficiently support string keys [SIndex](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn:1312/opensource/xindex/-/tree/sindex).
