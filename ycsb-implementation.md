# Implementation log of YCSB

- TODO
	+ TODO: Use loading phase to pre-load 100M records into stoarge server (NOTE: without in-switch cache)
	* TODO: Overwrite workload based on config (map workload name into workload property), cancel required param for workload property
		- TODO: Remove -df from command-line parameters
	* TODO: Use custom pair for SCANRES_SPLIT
	* TODO: Change permission to all users for rocksdb files after loading

- 10.8
	+ Siyuan
		* Update jnisrc to use libcommon (add methodid into inswitchcache-java-lib::SocketHelper)
		* TODO: Update inswitchcache.core.PacketFormat as libcommon (introduce methodid yet NOT affect UDP packet content)
			- TODO: Implement dynamic_serialize for put/insert; use udpsendlarge_ipfrag for put/insert
		* Code review
			- TODO: Review code related with ByteBuffer
			- TODO: Review code related with remote_client.c (e.g., add preparefinish_client in prebenchmark of farreach)
		* TODO: Encapsulate an individual class for GET/PUT/DEL/SCAN (general for each method) (NOT need InetAddress of ip and svraddr of udprecvfrom)
		* TODO: Implement NoCacheClient, NetCacheClient, DistfarreachClient, DistnocacheClient, and DistcacheClient in YCSB (just with different methodids)
		* TODO: Support range query
			- TODO: Add _udprecvlarge_multisrc_ipfrag and _udprecvlarge_multisrc_ipfrag_dist in JNI-based socket
			- TODO: Add parsebufs_multisrc_ipfrag(_dist) for udprecvlarge_multisrc_ipfrag(_dist) in Java
		* TODO: Dump per-second latency histogram and throughput of each physical client into temporary file
			- TODO: Use script to aggregate the per-physical-client statistics into final statistics
		* TODO: Encapsulate GET/PUT/DEL/SCAN in inswitchcache-c-lib/ for remote_client.c
	+ HuanCheng
		* TODO: Test farreach/nocache/netcache under hotin pattern of six YCSB workloads (some workloads may not be supported now, e.g. workloads with range query)

- 10.7
	+ Siyuan
		* Check correctness of JNI on UDP checksum for cache hits/misses
		* Re-organize ycsb/ as benchmark/, including ycsb/, inswitchcache-java-lib/, inswitchcache-c-lib/, output/, results/
			- Use inswitchcache.core.Key/Value/SocketHelper in farreach
			- Disaggregate JAVA-based lib for YCSB
		* Update scripts and benchmark.md (make rocksdb/common and then make each method in scripts/local/make\*.sh)
	+ Huancheng
		* Fix inconsistent hash_partition_idx issue of key
		* Double-check packet format of GET/PUT/DEL/ TODO LOAD request and response
		* TODO: Reproduce preliminary results of farreach on 4 cases
			- Without cache (1 case): client w/ workload mode = 1 + server w/ workload mode = 0 + NO warmup phase
			- With cache (3 cases): client and server w/ workload mode = 1 + warmup phase on hotin/hotout/random dynamic workloads

- 10.5 - 10.6
	+ Siyuan: Disaggregate C-based lib for remote_client.c and server for ALL methods
		* [IMPORTANT] NOTE: the first commit for libcommon is b18b0a3e10f0b3fe76e7006fdfc1d0f38925507d with message of "add common module for benchmarks and servers"
		* Place the same modules into common/ (including crc32, key, value, dynamic_array, dynamic_rulemap, helper, latency_helper, pkt_ring_buffer, snapshot_record, special_case, workloadparser/\*, iniparser/\*)
			- Merge ALL packet_format\.* as a single file with methodid as a parameter, and place it into common/
			- Introduce methodid into socket_helper, rocksdb_wrapper, io_helper
				+ NOTE: pkt_ring_buffer and dynamic_rulemap ONLY need packet_type_t -> NOT introduce methodid as parameter
		* Compile common/ as libcommon.a for benchmark/ and method/
			- Update usage of packet_format, socket_helper, rocksdb_wrapper, io_helper (files: loader.c, localtest.c, remote_client.c, server_impl.h, switchos.c, controller.c, recover/\*) -> SYNC to ALL
			- Update Makefile and includes by running replace.sh -> SYNC to ALL

## History log

- 10.3 - 10.4
	+ Siyuan
		+ Code for dynamic workload
			* Update helper.h, warmup_client.c, and ycsb_parser.c for new filepath and new file format -> SYNC to ALL
			* Add large value in JNI -> update header file after fixing java compilation errors
			* Implement rulemap generation for hot-in, random, and hot-out workload
		+ Fix tiny issues
			* Remove -cf and -threads from command-line parameters
			* Place all command-line parameters related with InswitchCache into GlobalConfig -> only use GlobalConfig in subthreads
		+ Set seed = threadid in random generator for each logical client in YCSB -> test keydump results
		+ Try individual jar
