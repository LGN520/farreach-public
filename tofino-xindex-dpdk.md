# Tofino-based forwarding + DPDK-based XIndex (tofino-xindex-dpdk)

## Implementation log

- Try TLDK
	+ Too complex to deploy
- DPDK-based CS architecture without persistency
	+ P4 problem: bf_switchd: /root/bf-sde-8.9.1/pkgsrc/bf-drivers/bf_switchd/bf_switchd.c:302: bf_switchd_pd_lib_init: Assertion pd_init_fn != ((void *)0)' failed'
		* Solve: rm corresponding directory in $SDE/p4-build/ and re-compile
	+ DWN status of port in tofino
		* You must enable correct port and launch your dpdk program (invoking rte_eth_dev_start)
	+ No packet sent to tofino
		* Tofino must enable the correct port, otherwise dpdk cannot send the packet
	+ No packet is transmitted to dl32
		* Type of IPv4 is 0x0008 in host (0x0800 is big endian)
